Description:
LogSentinel is a command-line tool designed for Security Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) purposes. It analyzes operating system log files to identify potential security risks based on predefined rules. The tool automatically detects suspicious activities, assigns risk levels, and provides detailed remediation recommendations to mitigate threats. LogSentinel generates both human-readable reports and machine-readable JSON outputs, allowing security analysts to quickly review and act on findings. With features like configurable risk rules, verbose scanning, and persistence of past scans, LogSentinel streamlines log-based risk analysis and supports proactive cybersecurity management.

Key Features:

Scan OS log files for declared risk patterns.

Predict risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on matched events.

Generate detailed remediation steps for detected risks.

Produce human-readable reports and JSON reports for integration.

Configurable rules via JSON for flexible risk definitions.

Verbose mode for step-by-step analysis feedback.

Persisted scan data for quick re-analysis without rescanning logs.

Use Case:
Ideal for system administrators, security analysts, and compliance officers to monitor system logs, detect suspicious behavior, and maintain regulatory compliance with minimal effort.
